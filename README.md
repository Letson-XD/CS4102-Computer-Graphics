# CS4102-Computer-Graphics
This project developed a WebGL renderer capable of showing a 3D object in a browser window.

## Part One:

A basic renderer for a 3D textured icosahedron with trimetric perspective and simple animation was developed. 

## Part Two:

A more advanced renderer for three 3D textured icosahedron with one-point perspective projection was developed. Sinusoidal animation and smooth shading with a white point light source was also implemented. 

## Part Three:

A successful implementation of stereo render in [anaglyph 3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaglyph_3D).

## Part Four:

Full Phong shading with a normal map and white point light source was added to the advanced renderer with a 3D textured icosahedron with one-point perspective projection and sinusoidal animation.
